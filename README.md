# COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAMMING IN JAVA 👨‍💻

---

Disclamier: This is the unoffical respository. I do not own the book, all rights go to Sabis®



## Why?
This is a side project and I am planning to answer all the questions because in my opinion it is one of the best books for beginners willing to learn Java


## What is included?
 - Answers to coding quesstion **ONLY** 
 - Test code for each questions
 - The question is included in each java file

### Questions
For the questions please refer to the top of each java file as it contains the corresponsing question.
```java
/**
 * Write a program that asks the user in the main method
 * to enter the weight of a person in kilograms and
 *  then call a method to return this weight in pounds
 * (1 kg = 2.20462 pounds)
 *
 * Sample output => Weight in kilogram is 65
 *                  Weight in pounds is 143.3003

```

#### Test
The java files also includes test code to see the ouput and check the results. To see ouput remove the comments and run the program. Specific instruction is provided for each question.
```java
// The main method to test and display the results
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        /*
         * The following block of code is to test the three methods above.
         * Remove the comments and change the numbers passed into the Point instance.
         */

//        Point p = new Point(3, 5);
//        p.display();

    }
```

## Directory
At first, the naming convention might seem odd; however, it follows the number of questions in each section. Each set of problems in the book is called a checkpoint, unfortunate there is no number system to represent the checkpoints. Within each chapter, there are several sections with a different number of checkpoints. The naming convention here is c_[the number of checpoint within that section].

### Example:
In chapter 3, section 3.1 checkpoint 4 is solved therefore the java file is called c_4. Here c stands for checkpoint and 4 represents the 4th checkpoint within that section
